This directory contains C definitions for symbols that gccgo links against.

golang.c contains definitions of the symbols that are needed to not get link
errors because they were referenced somewhere in the kernel Go code. kernel.c
contains references to functions in the Go kernel that are needed by golang.c. 

Everything else is taken from the gccgo runtime frontend, to ensure that the
signatures match what's expected. The LICENSE file in this directory applies
to those files.

In any more symbols are missing, see: 
https://github.com/golang/gofrontend/tree/master/libgo/runtime
to figure out what they should be defined as.
